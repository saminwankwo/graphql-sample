## Introduction

This API is built using GraphQL, a powerful query language and runtime for APIs. It provides a flexible and efficient way to query and manipulate data, making it an ideal choice for modern web applications.

## Technologies Used

- GraphQL
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Features

- Flexible data queries and mutations
- Efficient data retrieval and manipulation
- Strong typing and schema validation
- Easy integration with front-end frameworks and libraries

## Getting Started

To get started with this API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saminwankwo/graphql-sample.git
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the environment variables:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

To use this API, follow the GraphQL schema defined in the `schema.graphql` file. You can send queries and mutations to the API endpoint at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.

For example, to retrieve a list of all users, send the following query:

```
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

To create a new user, send the following mutation:

```
mutation {
  createUser(name: "John Doe", email: "john.doe@example.com") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```
